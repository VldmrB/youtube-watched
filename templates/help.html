                Enter the path to the directory with the files. Files with partially overlapping records are
                fine.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's best to either extract each Takeout archive to a directory with the same name as the
                archive and then point to the directory containing all of them
                <br>
                --- or ---
                <br>
                manually move the actual watch-history files into one directory while appending a number
                at the end of each name, e.g. watch-history_001.html, from oldest to newest.
            </p>
            The files will only be located within the given directory if any of the following is inside:
            <ul>
                <li>watch-history files themselves</li>
                <li>Directories of the download archives, extracted with the same
                    name as the archives e.g. "takeout-20181120T163352Z-001"</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The search will become confined to one of these types after the first match, e.g. if a
                watch-history file is found in the very directory that was passed, it'll continue looking for
                those in the same place, but not in Takeout directories.

        <h3>Data retrieval and insertion process</h3>
        <p>
            Depending on the amount of video records, the process will likely take 30+ minutes. ~15k records
            will create a database of ~40MB.
        </p>
        <p>
            Should the process get interrupted for any reason, it's safe to restart it using the same Takeout
            files; no duplicates will be created.
        </p>
        <p>
            Google API standard daily quota is 1M query points. Each video request (at least a successful one)
            seems to use 11 points.

        <h3>Takeout quirks and need-to-know</h3>
        <p>
            Takeout works strangely (badly). The three times I've used it, it
            returned varying numbers of records, the second time returning fewer than the first and the last
            returning more than the first two, including records older than the ones in the first two as well as
            records sprinkled throughout the whole watch history that too were missing from the first two
            Takeouts. The oldest records available were from the start of 2014.
        </p>
        It does not seem to return a full watch history in any case, when compared to the
        History page on Youtube, though the difference is not drastic.
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
            If a video has been deleted, its only data will be the timestamp of when it was watched and
            sometimes its id. These will be inserted as 'unknown'.
