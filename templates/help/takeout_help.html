            Depending on the amount of video records, the process will likely take 40+ minutes. ~15k records
            will create a database of ~40MB.
        </p>
        <p>
            Should the process get interrupted for any reason, it's safe to restart it using the same Takeout
            files; no duplicates will be created.

            Google API standard daily quota is 1M query points. Each video request (at least a successful one)
            seems to use 11 points. The Quotas tab on Google's

        <h3>Takeout quirks</h3>
        <p>
            Takeout works strangely (badly). The three times I've used it, varying numbers of records were returned,
            the second time returning fewer than the first and the last returning more than the first two, including
            records older than the ones in the first two as well as records sprinkled throughout the whole watch
            history that too were missing from the first two Takeouts. The oldest records were from the start of 2014,
            with the Youtube account being created and first used sometime in 2011.
        </p>
        It does not seem to return a full watch history in any case, when compared to the History page on Youtube,
        though the difference is not drastic.
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
            If a video has been deleted, its only data will be the timestamp of when it was watched and
            sometimes its id. These will be inserted as 'unknown'.
