        <h2>The goal of the app</h2>
        <p>is to gather some data about your YouTube watch history and do some light visualization of it.
            There's a few interactive graphs and tables on the Visualize page, and then there's the data itself that
            could be used for more.
            An SQLite browser
            (ex. <a class="link-btn link-btn:visited" href="https://sqlitebrowser.org/" target="_blank"
            >DB Browser for SQLite</a>) could be used for exploring the data and making simple graphs as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is not a tool for exhaustive data gathering and record keeping. Even if it tried to be,
            inaccuracies of Takeout data would not allow for that (read below to see why).

        <h2>Restrictions</h2>
        <p>
            Only Takeout files in English can be parsed. Adjusting code in src/convert_takeout.py
            (functions get_watch_history_files and get_all_records) could get it to work with another language.
            Alternatively, switching your language to English
            <a class="link-btn link-btn:visited"
               href="https://myaccount.google.com/language?utm_source=google-account&utm_medium=web"
               target="_blank">here</a> should make the Takeout archives created afterwards be in English.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's possible the format of watch-history.html files used to be different in the past, in which case those
            would likely not be parsable either. If that happens, open an issue on GitHub and I'll see about making
            it work.
        </p>

    <div class="help-item">
        <h2>Data retrieval and insertion</h2>
        <p>
            Takeout's watch-history.html file(s) gets parsed for the available info. Some records will only contain a
            timestamp of when the video was opened/watched, presumably when the video itself is no longer available.
            Most will also contain the video ID, title and the channel title.
        </p>
        <p>
            All the IDs are then queried against YouTube Data API for additional information. Combined with the
            timestamps from Takeout, the records are then inserted into a database, located in the project directory
            under the default name of yt.sqlite. Those without identifying info are collectively inserted
            as a single 'unknown'.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each successful query to the API uses 11 points, with the standard daily quota being 1M.
            The Quotas tab on Google's
            <a class="link-btn link-btn:visited"
               href="https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/youtube.googleapis.com/overview"
               target="_blank">Console</a>
            page will show how many have been used up.
        </p>
        <p>
            Should the process get interrupted for any reason, it's safe to restart it using the same Takeout
            files; no duplicates will be created and no duplicate queries will be made (except 1 every time). It's best
            not to re-use the same files after their records have been fully inserted, however, as that slows down the
            process for no good reason.

        <h2>Takeout quirks and data accuracy</h2>
        <p>
            Takeout works strangely (badly). The first three times I've used it, varying numbers of records were
            returned each time. The second time returned fewer than the first and the last returned more than the
            first two, including records older than the ones in the first two as well as additional records
            throughout the whole watch history. The next few I paid attention to also varied in the amount returned.
        </p>
        <p>
            The oldest records were from April of 2014, with the Youtube account having been created and first
            used sometime in 2011.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to that, all the archives were missing some amount of records for each year they did cover,
            when compared to the History page on Youtube, though the difference wasn't drastic. Curiously, the
            History page was also missing some videos that were present in Takeout.
        </p>
        <h4>Timestamps</h4>
        <p>
            In short, the timestamps can be very inaccurate and the app doesn't fix that.
            They shouldn't be relied on for anything precise, but would work fine for a rough overview of activity over
            a given period of time, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is no timezone information beyond coming from Takeout beyond abbreviations like EDT/PST/CET and so on.
            The timestamps seem to be returned in local time of the computer the Takeout archive creation
            was initiated on (including those for videos that may have been watched in a different timezone).
            However, changing the timezone on my machine never triggered a change in the timestamps, so it's probably
            more complicated than that.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the case of zones observing Daylight Saving Time (DST), all of the timestamps seem to be set to
            either the DST timezone or the non-DST one, depending on the date the archive was created. That
            is, if someone who lives on the East coast of US creates an archive in May, all the timestamps, including
            ones that should be in EST (November - March) will be set to EDT and vice versa if it gets created in
            February.
        </p>
        <h4>Duplicate timestamps because of potential different timezones for different Takeout archives</h4>
        <p>
            Since different Takeout archives may have different timezones, depending on when/where they were downloaded,
            there may be duplicate timestamps in different timezones. To weed out the duplicates, any timestamps for
            the same video ID that have been watched at the same year, month, minute and second as well as less than
            26 hours apart are treated as one. This may also block a limited amount of legitimate timestamps from being
            entered. Most if not all of them would be the ones attached to the 'unknown' record.
            Considering the records returned by Takeout are not complete as is, a few (7 unknown ones for me) extra lost
            timestamps seemed like a good trade-off.
